# SV-Memory Protocol Rules

This project uses 'sv-memory' for persistent architectural memory, progress journals, and structural context graph.

## Session Lifecycle (REQUIRED, in this order):

1. **Start:** Call 'sv_mem_session_start' at the beginning of work. It returns an **Auto-Boot Context Bundle** with the previous session summary, key architectural decisions, standards, recent bugfixes, last journals, and top graph hubs — read it and use it as your starting context.
2. **Associate saves:** Pass 'session_id' to 'sv_mem_save' to group memories under the active session. If omitted, the active session is auto-detected.
3. **Capture knowledge as you go:** Save journals, decisions, standards, and bugfixes with 'sv_mem_save' (see the Memory Capture Guidelines below). Use 'sv_mem_capture_passive' for lightweight observations that do not need an explicit save decision.
4. **Summary:** Call 'sv_mem_session_summary' with goal, discoveries, accomplished work, and next steps before closing.
5. **End:** Call 'sv_mem_session_end' to mark the session as completed and enable context recovery in the next session.

After a compaction or context reset, call 'sv_mem_context' to recover the last session state (goal, summary, associated memories).

## Tool Usage in Any Mode:

The sv-memory tools (session, memory, graph, diagnostics) may be called in ANY operational mode — plan, build, or review. They persist only to the project memory store ('.sv-memory/'), which is project data, not source code. Do not skip memory capture, context recovery, or the session lifecycle because of the current mode.

## Context Initialization (Search-Before-Work):

Memory must be consulted before proposing or executing changes:
- **Orientation:** On a new project, call 'sv_mem_stats' first — it is the cheapest overview of memory distribution (categories, counts, sessions).
- **Targeted search:** Call 'sv_mem_search' with the topic keywords of your task (feature, component, style, module). Filter by category when relevant ('journal', 'postmortem', 'discussion', 'idea', 'qa', 'architecture', 'decision'). Avoid repeating redundant searches — the Auto-Boot Bundle already carries the previous session context.
- **Proactive search:** On first user message referencing a project, feature, or problem, call 'sv_mem_search' with their keywords before responding. Never answer from assumptions alone — memory first, code second.

## Progressive Disclosure (Token-Efficient Retrieval):

Use the 3-layer pattern to minimise tokens:
- **Layer 1 — Search:** Call 'sv_mem_search' to get a compact list (IDs + titles + topic keys) of relevant memories (~30 tokens/result).
- **Layer 2 — Timeline:** Call 'sv_mem_timeline(observation_id=...)' to see chronological context around a specific memory (includes the central observation rationale).
- **Layer 3 — Get full content:** Call 'sv_mem_get(id=...)' to retrieve the full content of a specific memory.
Never dump all fields from search — drill down on demand. The top search result is already expanded inline, so only drill further when you need deeper detail.

## Topic Keys (Upsert Semantics):

- Use 'sv_mem_suggest_topic_key(category, what)' to generate a stable 'category/kebab-case' key.
- Pass 'topic_key' to 'sv_mem_save' to enable upsert: saves to the same project+topic update in place (revision_count++) instead of creating a new record.
- Use topic keys for evolving topics (architecture decisions, design systems, long-running features, recurring patterns). Skip for one-off bugs or single facts.
- **Convention:** Always kebab-case in English. Examples: 'standard/design-system', 'architecture/component-card', 'decision/use-bun-instead-of-npm', 'standard/workflow-git-commits', 'bugfix/tab-transition-absolute-position'.

## Memory Capture Guidelines (when to save what):

Always persist design knowledge as structured memories with a topic_key, not just session journals:

| Situation | Category | topic_key example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Visual style / design system / CSS / Tailwind tokens | 'standard' | standard/design-system |
| Reusable component or UI pattern | 'architecture' | architecture/component-card |
| Workflow / methodology / build & dev process | 'standard' | standard/workflow-dev-process |
| Architectural decision made (and its rationale) | 'decision' | decision/... |
| Code convention / naming / folder structure | 'standard' | standard/code-conventions |
| Complex or non-obvious bug fixed | 'bugfix' | bugfix/... |
| Relevant Q&A with lasting value | 'qa' | qa/... |
| Rejected library or framework feature | 'decision' | decision/avoid-... |
| Session progress checkpoint | 'journal' | journal/... |

**Golden rule:** when you define, change, or reuse a style, component, methodology, or convention, save it as 'standard' or 'architecture' with a topic_key. A journal is not a substitute — journals document progress, 'standard'/'architecture'/'decision' preserve the "how" and the "why" for future sessions.

## Graph Inspection (before modifying code):

- **Orient before touching code:** Call 'sv_graph_god_nodes' to see the most-connected hub nodes — these are the architectural hotspots any change may ripple through.
- **Understand a module:** Call 'sv_graph_explain(node=...)' before refactoring, deleting, or restructuring a file/module. It reports the node's role, community, centrality, fan-in/fan-out, neighbors, and suggested questions.
- **Inspect dependencies:** Call 'sv_graph_query(path_or_node=...)' to see a module's dependency sub-graph (imports/calls/depends_on) with depth, direction, and relation-type filters.
- **Trace a connection:** Call 'sv_graph_path(source=..., target=...)' to find the shortest dependency path between two nodes.

## Graph Refresh:

Execute 'sv_graph_sync' after adding major new files, creating new packages, or modifying package structures/imports. The graph is rebuilt incrementally and communities/centrality are computed lazily when queried.

## Memory Maintenance (periodic):

- **Review:** Call 'sv_mem_review' to list stale, duplicate, or consolidation-candidate memories.
- **Conflicts:** Call 'sv_mem_conflicts action=scan' to detect potential duplicate memories; judge them with 'sv_mem_judge' (supersedes / conflicts_with / relates_to) or with 'action=scan semantic=true' to LLM-judge candidates via the agent CLI. Keep relations coherent.
- **Compare:** Call 'sv_mem_compare(id1, id2)' before judging two similar memories.
- **Compact:** Call 'sv_mem_compact' periodically or after many topic-key upserts to consolidate revisions and keep search fast.

- **Pin / Priority:** sv_mem_pin, sv_mem_unpin
- **Knowledge quality:** sv_mem_suggest_topic_key, sv_mem_judge, sv_mem_compare, sv_mem_compact, sv_mem_review, sv_mem_capture_passive, sv_mem_conflicts, sv_mem_stats, sv_mem_current_project, sv_mem_diagnose

## Repository Restrictions & Commit Standards:

- **Commit Format:** Always provide commit messages using the Conventional Commits format (e.g., 'feat(scope): description'). Use the project's configured commit language (default: English), unless the project specifies otherwise.
- **Forbidden Actions:** You MUST NOT run 'git add', 'git commit', or 'git push' commands autonomously. The user must review changes and run these commands manually.
